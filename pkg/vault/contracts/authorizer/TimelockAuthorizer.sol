/**
 * @title Timelock Authorizer
 * @author Balancer Labs
 * @dev Authorizer with timelocks (delays).
 *
 * Users are allowed to perform actions if they have the permission to do so.
 *
 * This Authorizer implementation allows defining a delay per action identifier. If a delay is set for an action, users
 * are instead allowed to schedule an execution that will be run in the future by the Authorizer instead of executing it
 * directly themselves.
 *
 * Glossary:
 * - Action: Operation that can be performed to a target contract. These are identified by a unique bytes32 `actionId`
 *   defined by each target contract following `IAuthentication.getActionId`.
 * - Scheduled execution: The Authorizer can define different delays per `actionId` in order to determine that a
 *   specific time window must pass before these can be executed. When a delay is set for an `actionId`, executions
 *   must be scheduled. These executions are identified with an unsigned integer called `scheduledExecutionId`.
 * - Permission: Unique identifier to refer to a user (who) that is allowed to perform an action (what) in a specific
 *   target contract (where). This identifier is called `permissionId` and is computed as
 *   `keccak256(actionId, account, where)`.
 *
 * Permission granularity:
 *   In addition to the who/what/where of a permission, an extra notion of a "specifier" is introduced to enable more
 *   granular configuration. This concept is used within the Authorizer to provide clarity among four ambiguous actions:
 *   granting/revoking permissions, executing scheduled actions, and setting action delays. For example, in managing
 *   the permission to set action delays, it is desirable to delineate whether an account can set delays for all
 *   actions indiscriminately or only for a specific action ID. In this case, the permission's "baseActionId" is the
 *   action ID for scheduling a delay change, and the "specifier" is the action ID for which the delay will be changed.
 *   The "baseActionId" and "specifier" of a permission are combined into a single "extended" `actionId`
 *   by calling `getExtendedActionId(baseActionId, specifier)`.
 *
 * Note that the TimelockAuthorizer doesn't make use of reentrancy guards on the majority of external functions.
 * The only function which makes an external non-view call (and so could initate a reentrancy attack) is `execute`
 * which executes a scheduled execution and so this is the only protected function.
 * In fact a number of the TimelockAuthorizer's functions may only be called through a scheduled execution so reentrancy
 * is necessary in order to be able to call these.
