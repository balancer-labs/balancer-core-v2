/**
 * @title Base Relayer Library
 * @notice Core functionality of a relayer allowing users to approve it to take further actions using a signature
 * @dev
 * Relayers are formed out of a system of two contracts:
 *  - A `BalancerRelayer` contract which acts as a single point of entry into the system through a multicall function
 *  - A library contract such as this which defines the allowed behaviour of the relayer
 *
 * NOTE: Only the entrypoint contract should be whitelisted by Balancer governance as a relayer and so the Vault
 * will reject calls made if they are not being run from within the context of the entrypoint.
 * This contract should neither be whitelisted as a relayer or called directly by any user.
 * No guarantees can be made about fund safety when calling this contract in an improper manner.
