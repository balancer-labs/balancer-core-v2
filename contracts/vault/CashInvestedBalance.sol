// This library is used to create a data structure that represents a token's balance for a Pool. 'cash' is how many
// tokens the Pool has sitting inside of the Vault. 'invested' is how many tokens were withdrawn from the Vault by the
// Pool's Investment Manager. 'total' is the sum of these two, and represents the Pool's total token balance, including
// tokens that are *not* inside of the Vault.
//
// 'cash' is updated whenever tokens enter and exit the Vault, while 'invested' is only updated if the reason tokens are
// moving is due to an Investment Manager action. This is reflected on the different methods available: 'increaseCash'
// and 'decreaseCash' for swaps and add/remove liquidity events, and 'cashToInvested' and 'investedToCash' for
// investment and divestment events.
//
// The Vault disallows the Pool's 'cash' ever becoming negative, in other words, it can never use any tokens that
// are not inside of the Vault.
//
// One of the goals of this library is to store the entire token balance in a single storage slot, which is we we use
// 128 bit unsigned integers for 'cash' and 'invested'. Since 'total' is also a 128 bit unsigned value, any combination
// of 'cash' and 'invested' that yields a 'total' that doesn't fit in that range is disallowed.
//
// We could use a Solidity struct to pack these two values together in a single storage slot, but unfortunately Solidity
// only allows for structs to live in either storage, calldata or memory. Because a memory struct still takes up a
// slot in the stack (to store its memory location), and because the entire balance fits in a single stack slot (two
// 128 bit values), using memory is strictly less gas performant. Therefore, we do manual packing and unpacking. The
// type we use to represent these values is bytes32, as it doesn't have any arithmetic operations and therefore reduces
// the chance of misuse.
