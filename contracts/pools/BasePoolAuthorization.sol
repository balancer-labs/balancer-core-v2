 * @dev Base authorization layer implementation for Pools.
 *
 * Pools can be assigned an owner account, which is the only one that can call the permissioned functions. Note that
 * this owner is immutable: more sophisticated permission schemes such as multiple ownership, granular roles, etc.,
 * should be built on top of this by making the owner a smart contract.
 *
 * Alternatively, if the owner is set to the zero address, the Pool switches to role-based access control using an
 * Authorizer.
