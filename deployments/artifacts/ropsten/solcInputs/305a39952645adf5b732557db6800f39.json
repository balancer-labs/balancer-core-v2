A single instance of it exists in the entire network, and it is the\n * entity used to interact with Pools by joining, exiting, or swapping with them.\n *\n * The `Vault`'s source code is split among a number of sub-contracts with the goal of improving readability and making\n * understanding the system easier. All sub-contracts have been marked as `abstract` to make explicit the fact that only\n * the full `Vault` is meant to be deployed.\n *\n * Roughly speaking, these are the contents of each sub-contract:\n *\n *  - `InternalBalance`: deposit, withdrawal and transfer of Internal Balance.\n *  - `Fees`: set and compute protocol fees.\n *  - `FlashLoanProvider`: flash loans.\n *  - `PoolRegistry`: Pool registration, joining, exiting, and Asset Manager interactions.\n *  - `Swaps`: Pool swaps.\n *\n * Additionally, the different Pool specializations are handled by the `GeneralPoolsBalance`,\n * `MinimalSwapInfoPoolsBalance` and `TwoTokenPoolsBalance` sub-contracts, which in turn make use of the\n * `BalanceAllocation` library.\n *\n * The most important goal of the `Vault` is to make token swaps use as little gas as possible. This is reflected in a\n * multitude of design decisions, from minor things like the format used to store Pool IDs, to major features such as\n * the different Pool specialization settings.\n *\n * Finally, the large number of tasks carried out by the Vault mean its bytecode is very large, which is at odds with\n * the contract size limit imposed by EIP 170 (https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-170). Manual tuning of the source code\n * was required to improve code generation and bring the bytecode size below this limit. This includes extensive\n * utilization of `internal` functions (particularly inside modifiers), usage of named return arguments, and dedicated\n * storage access methods, to name a few.\n */\ncontract Vault is VaultAuthorization, FlashLoanProvider, Swaps {\n    constructor(\n        IAuthorizer authorizer,\n        IWETH weth,\n        uint256 emergencyPeriod,\n        uint256 emergencyPeriodCheckExtension\n    )\n        VaultAuthorization(authorizer)\n        AssetTransfersHandler(weth)\n        EmergencyPeriod(emergencyPeriod, emergencyPeriodCheckExtension)\n    {\n        // solhint-disable-previous-line no-empty-blocks\n    }\n\n    function setEmergencyPeriod(bool active) external authenticate {\n        _setEmergencyPeriod(active);\n    }\n}\n"
